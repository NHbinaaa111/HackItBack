Quick explaination:

Note: The tool only works when you remember some part of the password and you remember if the other parts were  letters, characters or numbers

Basically what this does is that it takes the remembered parts of your password, and some assumption values that you need to provide and merges them both and creates a list. This list has a very good chance to contain your original password and you can use this list to carry out dictionary attacks on your account. 

please do remember, it's not meant to hack another person's account
